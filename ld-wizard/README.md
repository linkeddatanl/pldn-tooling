<H1>LD Wizard</H1>

The LD Wizard is a new linked data tool that can be used to create linked data from tabular source data in csv-format during e.g. hackathons. Several variants of this tool will be available: The generic Hello World variant, a Cultural Heritage variant and a Cadastre variant. For more information, check:

We are looking at a possible date early 2021 to organize a LD Wizard Workshop, where the participants get a short tutorial on how the LD Wizard works and where they can experiment with the LD Wizard with their own csv-files. We will publish the date and the details also via our PLDN communication channels.
