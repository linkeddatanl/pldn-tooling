<H1>LD Wizard</H1>

The LD Wizard is a new linked data tool, developed by [Triply](https://triply.cc/) for The Dutch Digital Heritage Network ([NDE](https://www.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/en/)), that can be used to create more easily linked data from tabular source data in csv-format during e.g. hackathons. Several variants of this tool will be available: The generic Hello World variant, a Cultural Heritage variant and a Cadastre variant. For more detailled information on the LD Wizard, check the:

- [LD Wizard video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/VO61pqKWw7A)

We are looking at a possible date early 2021 to organize a first LD Wizard Workshop online, where the participants get a short tutorial on how the LD Wizard works and where they can experiment with the LD Wizard with their own csv-files. We will publish the date and the details of this workshop on the short term and also via our regular PLDN communication channels (PLDN Website, PLDN LinkedIn Group, PLDN Twitter Account and in one of our future PLDN Newsletters, etc.).
