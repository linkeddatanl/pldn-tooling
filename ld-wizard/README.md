<H2>PLDN Lab environment - LD Wizard</H2>

The LD Wizard is a new linked data tool, developed by [Triply](https://triply.cc/) for The Dutch Digital Heritage Network ([NDE](https://www.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/en/)), that can be used to create more easily linked data from tabular source data in csv-format during e.g. hackathons. Several variants of this tool will be available: The generic Hello World variant, a Cultural Heritage variant and a Cadastre variant. For more detailled information on the LD Wizard, check the:

On February 4th, a Lighweight Linked Data Publishing session was organized, where two Linked Data Publishing Best Practices will be presented, one for smaller datasets with the LD Wizard and one for large datasets with the Kadaster Data Science toolset. The presentations, video recording, chat text, links to websites and GitHub pages, a link to a Weaver PLDN test environmenta and to a SearchData  Kadaster demo environment can be found on the event page: [PLDN Seminar Linked Data Publiceren](https://www.pldn.nl/wiki/Lichtgewicht_Linked_Data_Publiceren_%E2%80%93_4_februari_2021).
