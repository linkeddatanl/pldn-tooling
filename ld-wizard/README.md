<H2>PLDN Lab environment - LD Wizards</H2>

The LDWizard is a new linked data tool, developed by [Triply](https://triply.cc/) for The Dutch Digital Heritage Network ([NDE](https://www.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/en/)), that can be used to create more easily linked data from tabular source data in csv-format during e.g. hackathons. Several variants of this tool will be available: The generic Hello World variant, a Heritage data variant and a Geo data variant. For more detailled information on the LDWizard, check the:

On February 4th, a PLDN Seminar Linked Data Publishing session was organized, where two Linked Data Publishing Best Practices were presented, one for smaller datasets with the LDWizard and one for large datasets with the Kadaster Data Science toolset. The presentations, video recording, chat text, links to websites and GitHub pages, a link to a Weaver PLDN test environmenta and to a SearchData Kadaster demo environment can be found on the event page: [PLDN Seminar Linked Data Publiceren](https://www.pldn.nl/wiki/Lichtgewicht_Linked_Data_Publiceren_%E2%80%93_4_februari_2021).
