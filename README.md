<H1>PLDN Tooling</H1>

This repository gives an overview of the linked data tooling that is available in our <strong>PLDN Lab Environment</strong> and for our <strong>PLDN Website</strong>:

- VocBench
- LD Wizard
- OpenRefine
- TriplyDB
- Semantic MediaWiki<br>

These tools are available <em>free of charge</em> for our PLDN Community Members that would like to experiment with small sets of Linked Data to get a better understanding of what Linked Data is and what you can do with it. The [PLDN Website](https://www.pldn.nl/wiki/Platform_Linked_Data_Nederland) is just one of our communication channels, that makes use of Linked Data "under the hood" to connect e.g. persons to organizations and to their skils and interests. The sub folders in this repository give you more details how you can get access to this tooling for each tool.
